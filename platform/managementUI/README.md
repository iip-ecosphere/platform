# IIP-Ecosphere platform Management UI

## Prerequisites (for Ubuntu Server, CI)

- install node.js and node package manager (npm): `sudo apt install nodejs npm`
- install Angular CLI: `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`

If you have an older version installed, you may have to execute

- `npm update -g`

Currently, we build the UI with npm version 9.5.1 and Angular 14.2.10.

## Running Management UI from Code

- install dependencies: change directory to /managementUi and run `npm install`
- environment variables: change directory to /managementUi/src/assets/config and edit config.json. Change ip to the platform ip that the UI is supposed to connect to
- serve managementUI: change directory to /managementUi and `run ng serve`

## Building the Management UI

- install dependencies: change directory to /managementUi and run `npm install` 
- Angular Projekt build: `ng build --base-href ./` creates a build and stores it in folder `dist`

## Setting up the Management UI

An installed management UI contains a setup JSON file in `assets/config/config.json`, which is created/modified during platform instantiation based on the UI configuration in the configuration model. Currently, an example looks as follows

    {
        "ip": "http://192.168.0.199:9001",
        "urn": "urn%3A%3A%3AAAS%3A%3A%3AiipEcosphere%23"
    }
    
whereby the `ip` points to the platform AAS server and the the `urn` denotes the URN of the platform AAS.

## Building the Management UI

Building happens through ``build.sh`` calling ``build-jk.xml`` in turn calling ``pom.xml``. So far there is no complete windows build process, i.e., if you want to run it, you may have to add ``pckg/IIP-Ecosphere-mgtUi-latest.zip`` from Jenkins or to run maven with `-Dbuildhelper.skipAttach`.
