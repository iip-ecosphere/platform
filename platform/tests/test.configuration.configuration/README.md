# IIP-Ecosphere platform test artifacts: Implementation classes for generated test apps

Test artifact containing simple implementation classes for test steams generated by the configuration layer, i.e., the [platform configuration component](platform/tree/main/platform/configuration/configuration/README.md).

This artifact contains the implementation artifacts for three cases, SimpleMesh, SimpleMesh3 and KodexMesh. Classes for SimpleMesh3 are marked with 3 in their name. This is a rather unusual but convenient setup for CI testing. Usually, each app shall have its own project.

Please note that this project requires the classes generated from the SimpleMesh/SimpleMesh3/KodexMesh test configuration. In turn, the SimpleMesh/SimpleMesh3 production processes use this artifact as service implementation. For "bootstrapping", just temporarily remove the Maven artifact specs from the test configuration, create the interface artifact, build this artifact and enable the artifact specs again.

This project also contains example Python service code for KodexMesh. The required generated/framework code is obtained and unpacked via Maven. Finally only the implemented services are packaged again for deployment into integration.

Depending on your installation, `-DskipTests` may be required when executing Maven (although the tests run in the CI enviroment).
