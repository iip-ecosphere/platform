# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Releases

### Next release (winter 2021):
* BaSyx upgrade to 1.0.0 (from Maven Central)
* Complete platform runs in Docker container, see [install information](../documentation/INSTALL.md) how to play with them.
* Installation summary for Docker containers and platform from scratch on github.
* Bug fixes / Improvements:
    * Missing resource headline/identifier in platform Cli
    * Wrong version numbers for platformDependencies/broker in Install package
    * Wrong content types file name when writing an AASX file
    * TLS encryption support for the basic transport connectors.
    * Spring transport connector instances/binders can be configured individually. TLS encryption support for the spring transport connectors/binders is available.
    * MQTT machine connectors support optional TLS encryption.
    * PID files for the major platform components
    * Generation of Linux/systemd service descriptions for platform services, ECS runtime and service manager. Generation of separate scripts for Java 8 (no module system).

    * Fixed/extended qualified name access for OPC UA connector.
    * Automated instantiation of a one-process ECS runtime/service manager without container manager for devices with low resources.

    * Initial integration of device management (BSc Dennis Pidun) with ThingsBoard, in-memory registry, MinIO and S3Fake connectors.
    * Code refactoring: Renaming setup-related "Configuration" classes to "Setup".

    * Python service execution environment
    * Integrated container management for Kubernetes
    * Automatic creation of containers and their accessibility for devices.
