# oktoflow platform: Tutorials

We prepared several videos on the oktoflow platform, in particular how to design and realize applications. Since the videos have been recorded, the platform evolved, i.e.,

* there were several platform releases, i.e., the version number in the videos are outdated, but you can replace the version with the most recent version as the discussed examples (mostly) use the same concepts.
* we are changing the locations of the models, in particular where the automatically obtained meta-model is located (``target/easy``, before ``src/main/easy``) and where the configuration is located (``src/main/easy``, before ``src/test/easy``)
* there is no mentioning of "oktoflow" as the name was invented later
* there are more examples in the platform than mentioned in the videos
