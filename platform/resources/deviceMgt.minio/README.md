# IIP-Ecosphere platform: central device management (Minio S3 storage extension)

This component provides a minio S3 storage implementation for the device management.

Please note that minio is an AGPL licensed component. As minio is currently the only implementation of the S3 storage, minio is considered as the default implementation although it does not fully comply with the IIP-Ecosphere licence rules.
