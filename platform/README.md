# IIP-Ecosphere platform 

The virtual IIP-Ecosphere Industry 4.0/IIoT platform aims at demonstrating new approaches to vendor-independent, interoperable and open platform concepts. In particular, it aims at uniform, distributed deployment of services to heterogeneous (edge) devices, an AI toolkit for the industrial production, consistent configuration support ranging from network to applications as well as the use and application of established and upcoming IIoT standards, e.g., asset administration shells (to be used for all platform interfaces).

The platform concepts and realization are developed by the IIP-Ecosphere consortium and are documented in several whitepapers:
  * The IIP-Ecosphere [Industry 4.0 platform overview](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4485756)
  * The IIP-Ecosphere [platform usage view](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.448580)
  * The IIP-Ecosphere [platform requirements(functional and quality view)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4485774)
  * The IIP-Ecosphere [platform handbook](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5168946) [link may be updated some days after code releases]

All material is also available from the [IIP-Ecosphere Website](https://www.iip-ecosphere.eu/).

## Documentation

For detailed documentation and development hints see [documentation overview](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/documentation/README.md). For a documentation of the releases of the IIP-Ecosphere platform see [releases overview](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/documentation/RELEASES.md). For information on using/installing the platform, please consult the [installation overview](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/documentation/INSTALL.md). 

We also prepare a set of [examples and demonstration use cases](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/examples/README.md).
