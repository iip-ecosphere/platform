# Connectors Component MODBUS/TCP extension in the Transport Layer of the oktoflow platform

MODBUS/TCP machine connector for bi-directional access to devices and machines and already installed platforms based on [Jamod](https://jamod.sourceforge.net/). We run the testswithout AAS factory installed in order to simplify 
the test. If required, additionally also an AAS server according to the ``AasPartRegistry`` must be initiated.
