# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Configuration default library

Basic code for devices or services integrated into the configuration meta-model. This project contains a simple/minimal configuration file to create the code for the data types defined in the platform configuration meta-model. The classes implemented in this project are based on the generated type classes.

The project setup differs a bit from the examples, indicating the future intended setup, namely the configuration meta-model in `target/easy`, the actual configuration in `src/main/easy`. After checkout, the project may show errors, which disappear when the maven build process has been executed.
