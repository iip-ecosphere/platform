# oktoflow platform: Configuration component

This part consists of all components that provide or modify the oktoflow platform configuration, either at before installation or during runtime. Currently, this component consists of 
- the IVML platform [configuration integration and the configuration meta model](configuration/README.md).
- the IVML platform [default implementation](configuration.defaultLib/README.md) of type or device-specific functionality for type or devices defined in the configuration meta-model.
- the [Maven plugin](configuration.maven/README.md) for embedding the IVML/VIL platform instantiator.

Further parts for dynamic deployment or adaptation are foreseen in the platform architecture.
