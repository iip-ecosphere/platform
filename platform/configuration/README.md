# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Configuration component

This part consists of all components that provide or modify the IIP-Ecosphere platform configuration, either at before installation or during runtime. Currently, this component consists of 
- the IVML platform [configuration integration and the configuration meta model](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/configuration/configuration/README.md).
- the [Maven plugin](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/configuration/configuration.maven/README.md) for embedding the IVML/VIL platform instantiator.

Further parts for dynamic deployment or adaptation are foreseen in the platform architecture.
