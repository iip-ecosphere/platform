# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Variability Instantiation Templates for specific operation systems

The templates target the following tasks

* Basics for instantiating operating-system specific Java artifacts (`JavaOsBasics`).
* `LinuxBash` creates bash scripts to start platform components. 
* `LinuxSysd` creates scripts to start platform components automatically via the Linux systemd. 
* `WinBatch` creates windows shell scripts to start platform components. 

The scripts may be executed multiple times, e.g., for Java 8, Java 9+, etc.
