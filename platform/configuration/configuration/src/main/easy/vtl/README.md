# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Variability Instantiation Templates, 'vtl'

Variability templates are used to generate or modify individual types of assets, e.g., kinds of Java, Python or Maven files. The templates are organized into

* Target language independent templates such as `Basics` and `ServiceBasics`.
* Templates focusing on Java artifacts (`java`).
* Templates focusing on Python artifacts (`python`).
* Templates that create scripts for operating systems, in particular Windows or Linux (`os`).
* Templates that are specific for certain platform services, e.g., KIPROTECT KODEX (`services`).
