# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Variability Instantiation Templates for Operating scripts

The templates target the following tasks

* `LinuxBash` creates Linux Bash startup scripts.
* `LinuxSysd` creates Linux system.d service startup scripts (assuming Java as symlink in installation directory, platform instantiated into gen in installation directory; both base paths optional in configuration).
* `WinBatch` creates Windows Bash startup scripts.
* `JavaOsBasics` Helper functions to determine Java arguments.
