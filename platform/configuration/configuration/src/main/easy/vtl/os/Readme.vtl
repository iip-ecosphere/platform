        For understanding the components and how to explore the platform, we recommend reading the platform handbook on:
          - https://www.iip-ecosphere.eu/
          - https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5168946
        
        This is an assembled and instantiated version of the IIP-Ecosphere platform of version ${cfg.iipVer}. 
        Components that are not configured to be part of the platform are left out. Glue code for services, wire 
        format serializers for application specific data types, logging configurations etc. are generated and packaged. 
        IP-Addresses for the central services became part of the binaries during packaging.
        
        This folder contains the top-level artifacts that are needed to execute the platform (in the following sequence):
          - The central platform services, in particular the AAS server
            - platform.bat for Windows
            - platform.sh for Linux/Bash
            - source code in "platform"
            - binaries in "plJars"
            - platform.service for Linux/systemd
          - The ECS runtime with container manager
            - ecs.bat for Windows
            - ecs.sh for Linux/Bash
            - source code in "ecsRuntime"
            - binaries in "ecsJars"
            - ecs.service (with dependency to platform.service) as well as ecs-noDeps.service (for standalone 
              device installation) for Linux/systemd
          - The service manager
            - serviceMgr.bat for Windows
            - serviceMgr.sh for Linux/Bash
            - source code in "serviceMgr"
            - binaries in "svcJars"
            - serviceMgr.service (with dependency to ecs.service) as well as serviceMgr-noDeps.service (for standalone 
              device/container installation) for Linux/systemd
          - For small resouces: ECS runtime without container manager but including service manager
            - ecsServiceMgr.bat for Windows
            - ecsServiceMgr.sh for Linux/Bash
            - source code in "ecsServiceMgr"
            - binaries in "ecsSvcJars"
            - ecsServiceMgr.service for Linux/systemd
          - The platform command line (so far, the platform does not have an UI but this may change in future ;))
            - cli.bat for Windows
            - cli.sh for Linux/Bash
            - source code also in "platform"
            - binaries also in "plJars"
