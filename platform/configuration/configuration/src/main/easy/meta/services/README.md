# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Configuration model (Service extensions in the Configuration Meta Model)

This folder contains extensions to the configuration model made by individual services. These services may be shipped with the platform as this is the case of KODEX and RTSA or they may be added later on. Naming of these files/projects always starts with "ServicePart".
