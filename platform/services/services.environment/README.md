# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Service execution environment

This component provides a multi-language service execution environment/support classes for IIP-Ecosphere. In particular,
a main task is to encapsulate the communication of services with the platform. 

The core here is a service interface for administrative purposes. The service interface can directly be mapped into a AAS implementation server and, thus, represent the AAS implementation side (we rely for now on BaSyx VAB through the AAS Factory).

However, it is important to recall, that this component shall not contain the full interfaces rather than basic and support interfaces. The full interfaces shall be derived via code generation for configured services and be based on the interfaces here. The support methods shall be called from generated code to create the implementation server, to map the service(s) into etc.

It is also important to recall, that the service execution environment is only fully operational within a running platform, as e.g., there is no AAS to control the services in standalone execution. To allow for standalone demonstration/debugging execution, the service starter can be asked to run a simplified service lifecycle via the command line option `--iip.test.service.autostart=true`. Services that are mapped into the service environment are startet then automatically and stopped upon JVM end (shutdown hook). Without this autostart functionality, services that require a transition into the running state will not be operational and will just consume data quietly without producing output.

## Java

On the Java side, this component provides the ``Service`` interface and a ``ServiceMapper`` linking the known service functions through ``ProtocolServerBuilder`` into an AAS implementation server. The Java environment also provides a ``MetricsProvider``, a facade to a micrometer monitoring registry, allowing for remote access to meters via REST. Moreover, (selected) information from the ``MetricsProvider`` is made available on AAS level (e.g., to be included into the service manager or ECS runtime), backed by a caching mechanism receiving regular monitoring information from predefined channels in the IIP-Ecosphere transport layer.

Further additional support classes allow reading basic information from the YAML service deployment descriptors (forward defintion for services component).

## Python

On the Python side, this component provides a simple framework around the "abstract" ``Service`` class and similar ``ServiceMapper`` linking the known service functions through a Python port of the ``ProtocolServerBuilder`` into an AAS implementation server. It is important to recall, that the Python side just provides the implementation server, currently for VAB-TCP and VAB-HTTP. 

Prerequisites/requirements:

- Python at least version 3.9
- Pyflakes at least version 2.5.0
- PyYaml at least version 6.0
- Websockets at least version 11.0.2

## Developing against the Application AAS

The `TraceToAasService` is a hybrid (generic, extensible) plattform-supplied service to provide an AAS nameplate of an application as well as a trace of the operations (tracing must be enabled on the services to be traced in the configuration model). To develop against the service, we provide a simple AAS setup with the service (in `TraceToAasServiceMain` in testing scope) as well as two scripts to start the service (`traceToAas.bat`, `traceToAas.sh`, both requiring a `mvn package` before).

For debugging, traced information (also status and monitoring telegrams) can be received and logged by the `TransportLogger`.

## missing

* Extended monitoring involving also implementation processes such as Python.
