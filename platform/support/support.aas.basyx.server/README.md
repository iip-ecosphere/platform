# AAS Component AAS/BaSxy server extension of the Support Layer of the IIP-Ecosphere platform

Extends the [default BaSyx AAS client abstraction](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/support.aas.basxy/README.md) implementation for [Eclipse Basyx](https://www.eclipse.org/basyx/) to represent an AAS server. We separated client and server side in particular to manage, reduce and optimizer the dependencies and resource usage on (Edge) client side.

For updating BaSyx, please refer to [Basyx AAS client abstraction](https://github.com/iip-ecosphere/platform/tree/main/platform/support.aas.basxy/README.md).
