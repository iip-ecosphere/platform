# IIP-Ecosphere platform: System metrics implementation for Phoenix Contact / PLCnext

Uses [PLCnext internal gRPC](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Service_Components/gRPC_Introduction.htm) to provide default measures. Seems to require AXC firmware 2020 and newer.

In development, testing against AXC/PLCnext.
