# oktoflow platform: support.boot

Basic abilities and interfaces for setting up the oktoflow platform. Must remain on Java 8 as some (external) components enforce Java 8. 

As this component partially acts for defining interfaces of plugins for which implementations are needed to test `support`. parts of the test here are "ridiculous" and need to be re-done in the plugin or in/by the using implementation.
