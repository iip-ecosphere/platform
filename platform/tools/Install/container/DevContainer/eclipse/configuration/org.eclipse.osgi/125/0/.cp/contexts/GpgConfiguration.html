<h1>Configuring GPG for use with Eclipse</h1>
<p>
For using an external GPG program with Eclipse, GPG must be configured to use a GUI
pop-up dialog for user interaction, for instance when asking for key passphrases or
smartcard PINs.
</p>
<p>
Standard installations of GPG such as the distributions available from
<a href="https://gnupg.org/download/index.html#sec-1-2">GnuPG</a> are normally
set up correctly out of the box. But in some cases, GPG on a system may be configured
to ask the user for passphrases and such always via a terminal (a command window).
In that case, GPG cannot be used by Eclipse.
</p>
<h2>Getting a Passphrase Dialog</h2>
<p>
In GPG, it is not the <code>gpg</code> program itself that asks for passphrases.
Instead, GPG uses a "hidden" system program <code>gpg-agent</code> to manage keys,
and that <code>gpg-agent</code> program in turn uses yet another program called
<em>pinentry</em> for actually asking the user for input. When <code>gpg</code>
is invoked to sign something, it starts <code>gpg-agent</code> if that isn't
running already. Once started, <code>gpg-agent</code> will continue running in
the background, and will be re-used by future <code>gpg</code> operations.
</p>
<p>
How GPG asks the user for passphrases is thus determined by how the <code>gpg-agent</code>
is configured. There are several possible reasons why <code>gpg-agent</code> might
use a terminal input instead of a GUI dialog:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Environment variable <b><tt>GPG_TTY</tt></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <code>gpg-agent</code> might have been started with environment variable
<tt><b>GPG_TTY</b></tt> being set. In that case, it may be sufficient to terminate
("kill") the currently running <code>gpg-agent</code> process. When called from
Eclipse, <tt><b>GPG_TTY</b></tt> is <em>not</em> set, so if the Eclipse invokes
GPG the next time, the <code>gpg-agent</code> should start normally and use a GUI
dialog.
</p>
<p>If that works, figure out where in your system <tt>GPG_TTY</tt> is set and do
<em>not</em> set it to prevent the problem from re-occurring.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fixed <em>pinentry</em> configuration</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <code>gpg-agent</code> may be configured to use a particular <em>pinentry</em>
program. This configuration is in a file <tt><b>gpg-agent.conf</b></tt> in the user's
GPG directory, on Unix at <tt><b>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</b></tt>, on Windows at
<tt><b>%APP_DATA%/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</b></tt>. This file may contain a configuration
for <code>pinentry-program</code>, which may be set to <code>pinentry-tty</code> or
<code>pinentry-curses</code>. In this case, remove the line or configure a GUI
pinentry explicitly, and  terminate the currently running <code>gpg-agent</code> process
and optionally restart it. (Otherwise it will be restarted on the next GPG operation
automatically.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Missing GUI <em>pinentry</em> program</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Your system may not have a <em>pinentry</em> for a GUI dialog installed. This should
rarely happen, and if so, only with third-party packages of GPG. Install the missing
pinentry programs on your system using the system's package installation tool.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Custom <em>pinentry</em> script</dt>
<dd>
<p>
For advanced users: some people reconfigure the GPG pinentry via <tt>gpg-agent.conf</tt>
by setting <code>pinentry-program</code> to a custom script that decides based on the
value of environment variable <tt><b>PINENTRY_USER_DATA</b></tt> whether to prompt via
a GUI dialog or via a terminal. If you have such a setup, make sure the script uses a
GUI dialog pinentry when the variable is not set. When called via Eclipse,
<tt><b>PINENTRY_USER_DATA</b></tt> is <em>not</em> set.
