		<h1 id="EGit">EGit</h1>
		<h2 id="Git_Protocol">Git Protocol</h2>
		<p>The git protocol is the application-layer protocol git uses for communication between a git client and an upstream (git server). It is implemented atop the transport protocol (like HTTPS or SSH). Git has two different protocols for communicating with an upstream. EGit 5.11 by default tries to use the more efficient 
			<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html" target="egit_external">protocol V2</a> for fetching and uses the older protocol V0 only if the server does not support protocol V2. Most git servers nowadays do support protocol V2. See also the information about 
			<a href="../../../JGit/New_and_Noteworthy/5.11/5.11.html#Git_Protocol" title="JGit/New_and_Noteworthy/5.11#Git_Protocol">JGit's use of protocol V2</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="SSH">SSH</h2>
		<p>EGit 5.11 no longer supports the JSch library for SSH connections. By default EGit now always uses the 
			<a href="https://mina.apache.org/sshd-project/" target="egit_external">Apache MINA sshd</a> SSH library. The preference setting that allowed users to choose which library to use has been removed.
		</p>
		<p>If environment variable GIT_SSH is set to the path of an SSH executable, EGit uses that external SSH program instead.</p>
		<h2 id="Properties_View">Properties View</h2>
		<p>As of EGit 5.11, the Eclipse Properties view shows information about a selected tag from the Git Repositories view.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="&quot;Screenshot show a selected tag in the Git Repositories view and the information shown in the Properties view.&quot;" border="0" src="images/EGit_5.11_Tag_Properties.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The properties view shows information about the tag itself and also about the git object the tag points to. When the "Tag message" or "Commit message" property is selected, the full message is shown in a focusable pop-up. When the tag target is a commit and is selected, buttons to open the commit in the History view or in the Commit Viewer are shown.</p>
		<p>In a similar manner the properties view also shows information about a commit opened in the Commit Viewer when the Commit Viewer is active.</p>
		<h2 id="Signatures">Signatures</h2>
		<h3 id="Creating_Signed_Tags">Creating Signed Tags</h3>
		<p>Functionality to sign 
			<i>commits</i> has been available since EGit 5.3. With version 5.11 it is now also possible to create OpenPGP-signed 
			<i>tags</i>:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="&quot;Screenshot of the EGit 5.11 tag creation dialog with the new checkbox for creating a signed commit highlighted.&quot;" border="0" src="images/EGit_5.11_Signed_Tag_Dialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>There is a new checkbox in the "Create Tag..." dialog for creating a signed tag. A signed tag will always be an annotated tag, i.e., a separate tag object recording the creator of the tag, the time the tag was created, and a tag message, even if it is empty. Lightweight tags, which are just git references pointing to a commit, cannot be signed.</p>
		<p>The checkbox initially shows the state as determined from the git configuration. There are two options in the git config that govern whether tags are signed. They are <tt>
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-taggpgSign" target="egit_external">tag.gpgSign</a></tt> and <tt>
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-tagforceSignAnnotated" target="egit_external">tag.forceSignAnnotated</a></tt>, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>The user can override this selection by explicitly checking or unchecking the checkbox.</p>
		<p>If git config 
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-usersigningKey" target="egit_external">user.signingKey</a> is set but no matching GPG key can be found, the dialog displays a warning instead of the checkbox.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Verifying_Commit_Signatures">Verifying Commit Signatures</h3>
		<p>EGit 5.11 can also verify OpenPGP signatures of commits. If switched on in the Git preferences, EGit will verify commit signatures and show the information in the Git History view:</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="&quot;Screenshot showing the Git/History preference page and the signature verification information in the Git History view.&quot;" border="0" src="images/EGit_5.11_Signature_Verify_Commit.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The information shown is similar to what 
			<b><tt>git log --show-signature</tt></b> shows, but is not identical. EGit uses the 
			<a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/" target="egit_external">Bouncy Castle</a> Java library to verify signatures (even if an 
			<a href="#Using_GPG_to_Sign_Commits_and_Tags">external GPG</a> is used to sign commits), so there are minor differences.
		</p>
		<p>Currently EGit only verifies commit signatures. There is no UI (yet) for showing verification information for tag signatures.</p>
		<h3 id="Using_GPG_to_Sign_Commits_and_Tags">Using GPG to Sign Commits and Tags</h3>
		<p>EGit by default uses the signing support that is provided by JGit, the Java git library it uses for all git functionality. This uses the 
			<a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/" target="egit_external">Bouncy Castle</a> Java crypto library to find and read GPG keys and to sign commits.
		</p>
		<p>In EGit 5.11, the user also has the option to use the GPG executable installed on the system instead. There are new settings in the 
			<i>Git&rarr;Committing</i> preference page:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="&quot;Screenshot of the EGit 5.11 Git/Committing preference page showing the new GPG-related settings&quot;" border="0" src="images/EGit_5.11_External_Gpg_Preference.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The user can choose between using the "Bouncy Castle library" or the "External GPG" for signing commits and tags. If "External GPG" is chosen, EGit will launch the GPG executable for signing commits or tags. It finds the GPG executable using the following rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the preference for "GPG Executable" is also set, it uses the path defined there. (This preference is shown disabled in the screenshot. It is enabled when "External GPG" is chosen.) Setting this is optional; see below.</li>
			<li>Otherwise, if the git config <tt>
				<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-gpgprogram" target="egit_external">gpg.program</a></tt> (or <tt>gpg.openpgp.program</tt>) is set, it uses that path from the git config.
			</li>
			<li>Otherwise, it looks for an executable named "gpg" (or "gpg.exe" on Windows) on the paths listed in the environment variable 
				<b><tt>PATH</tt></b>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Normally it is 
			<i>not</i> necessary to set the path to the GPG executable in the Eclipse preferences. Doing so may help if for some reason the value defined in the git config is not appropriate for Eclipse, or if Eclipse cannot find the GPG executable on the <tt>PATH</tt>. (On OS X, the <tt>PATH</tt> for GUI programs started via the Finder is not the same as the <tt>PATH</tt> in a <tt>bash</tt> shell, and is typically much shorter. EGit uses the <tt>PATH</tt> as defined in <tt>bash</tt> on OS X.)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> Eclipse needs a GPG that interacts with the user via GUI dialogs, for instance to ask for a passphrase for a protected GPG key. If GPG is configured to ask for user input in a terminal, Eclipse cannot interact with GPG. In that case, an error dialog is shown with a "Help" button, which links to a help page with some additional hints about where the problem might be and how it might be corrected.
		</p>
		<p>Out of the box, the standard GPG distributions from 
			<a href="https://gnupg.org/download/index.html#sec-1-2" target="egit_external">GnuPG</a> are set up to use GUI dialogs and are thus usable by Eclipse.
		</p>
		<p>When an external GPG executable is used, Eclipse leaves 
			<i>all</i> key handling for signing commits or tags to GPG. GPG will use the <tt>gpg-agent</tt>, and it will automatically prompt for smartcard PINs or key passphrases, and it may on some systems provide integration with the system's global key chain to avoid repeated passphrase entry. Eclipse and EGit are not involved in any of these steps. EGit only tells GPG what to sign (the raw data of the commit or tag) with which key, identified by git config <tt>
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-usersigningKey" target="egit_external">user.signingKey</a></tt> or the committer's e-mail address, if not set.
