# Bug 490515 - Prevent upgrade from old to new EPP package layout
# https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=490515
#
# With Eclipse Neon (4.6.0) all packages changed their structure from a single
# feature to a product with multiple independent root features. Upgrades from
# older versions to the new structure would result in an unexpected uninstall
# of everything below the old main package feature. In order to prevent such
# upgrades we add an artificial lower limit of the IU to the p2 metadata.
