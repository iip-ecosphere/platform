# IIP-Ecosphere platform: Setup for an implementation project.

Contains the service implementation. There is a second project in the same folder called `impl.model` as prerequisite.
We assume that you completed the steps in `impl.impl`.

Typical steps:
  * Import your shared artifact generated in `impl.model` as dependency in this project.
  * Implement your Java/Python services.
  * Compile, package and deploy your code.
  * Go back to `impl.model`.
